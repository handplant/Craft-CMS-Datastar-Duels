# ⚔️ Craft CMS - Datastar Duels

**Versus** is a minimalistic app built with [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/)
and [Datastar](https://plugins.craftcms.com/datastar) to let two things go head-to-head — and
let the crowd decide. Whether it's **tabs vs spaces**, **cats vs dogs**, or **light mode vs dark mode** – anything can
duel. The votes decide
what's hot.
